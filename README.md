# Colourful
A super simple colour picking tool made using electron.  

Inspired by Toinane/colorpicker and the google online colour picker which disappears when I need it most.  

To build the application you need electron and node.js  
Run `npm install` after cloning the repository  
Start the application by running `npm start`   
To build the application yourself, run `npm run make`
