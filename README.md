# colour-tool
A super simple colour picking tool made using electron.  

Inspired by Toinane/colorpicker and the google online colour picker which disappears when I need it most.  

To build the application you need electron and node.js  
Run `npm install` after cloning the repository  
Start the application by running `npm start`   

23/09/22: There are no releases for this app yet  

## goals:
- Alpha channel toggle
- Better UI for colour sliders
- Hexadecimal colour input
- Changing slider values when changing hexadecimal input
## could possibly try doing:
- Colour history
- Adding a colour wheel
- Adding options for different colour models (HSL, HSV)
